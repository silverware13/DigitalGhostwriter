DIGITAL GHOSTWRITER README

Digital ghostwriter is designed to be run on a Linux machine that is using some
graphical desktop environment (We used CentOS 7, with Gnome).

Installation / Setup:

1. python3.6 or higher must be installed on your system.

2. Install tensorflow on your system at the directory ~/venvs/tensorflow.
Guide for CentOS 7: https://gist.github.com/thoolihan/28679cd8156744a62f88
Guide for other: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

3. Extract the contents of the dgw.zip file. You have completed installation / setup.

Running Digital Ghostwriter:

To run Digital Ghostwriter open the dgw directory and run the command: 
./exeDGW
Alternately if you installed tensorflow to a directory that was not listed above
run the following commands:
source ~/(location of tensorflow)/bin/activate
python3.6 dgw.py

Viewing genre and authors:

From the main menu select "genre", here you will see current completed
genres (You should see comedy, horror, and science fiction).
Next click on a genre to see the authors for that genre. 

Creating a story:

From the main menu select "write", you will greeted with a page that allows you to
select a genre, a word count, and a file name. You must enter a valid value for each
or else the program will not allow you to continue. 

Once you are satisfied with your selections you must hit done to continue.
This may take up to five minutes based on the computer you are using.

When you see a page that says that the story has been written and saved, you may exit
the program (red button in the top right corner of the screen) or continue to write
more stories. 

Your finished story can be found in the "stories" folder, it will be named
(the name you entered).txt. It will match the word count you entered, and
be written based on the genre you selected.
